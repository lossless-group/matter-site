**Command**: Refactor a Design for Three Visual Modes

It's likely we just created a new design (a section, component, or page) and we don't always remember to implement that design for all three modes.  So, now we have to refactor a bit and probably iterate too.

We have three visual modes for our websites:
1. Dark - Relatively simple, but also a bit glassmorphic and tech-forward. For geeks who have their browser in Dark Mode, who are reading information late at night after they should have gone to sleep.  
2. Light - Relatively bare, for professionals who want to get straight to the point and aren't impressed with flare. 
3. Vibrant - Full of bright colors, gradiants, glows. For the stylish hipsters who want to see love and care into beautiful and elegant visual design.

This requires that we maintain tweaked color palettes across three modes, and will also likely require component swaps, or specific CSS instructions based on which mode is active.
