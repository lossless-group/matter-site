### 1. Global aging population: toward ~2B people 60+ by 2050

- The United Nations projects the number of people **aged 60+ will roughly double to about 2.1 billion by 2050**. [^1ucdcd]  
- The population aged **65+ is expected to reach around 1.6–1.58 billion by 2050**, nearly double today’s ~857 million. [^3lhrqq] [^xs9htq]  
- People 65+ will represent **~16–17% of the world’s population by 2050**, up from about 10% today. [^3lhrqq] [^xs9htq]  
- The **“oldest old” (80+) will more than triple**, from 126.5 million in 2015 to 446.6 million by 2050, increasing demand for health, care, and prevention solutions. [^xs9htq]  
- In Asia, **one in four people will be over 60 by 2050**, with some economies (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan) nearing **40% of population aged 65+**. [^1ucdcd] [^3lhrqq]  
- In the U.S., those **65+ will rise from 58 million (17% of population in 2022) to 82 million (23%) by 2050**, reshaping healthcare, housing, and labor markets. [^7d6fsj] [^7hvbv5]

These shifts are described by the UN as a **“defining global trend of our time”** and a “major success story” that creates both challenges and opportunities in health, labor, and social systems.

### 2. Breakthroughs in CRISPR, senolytics, and AI-driven drug discovery

**CRISPR and genetic interventions**

- CRISPR-Cas systems have rapidly evolved from basic gene editing to **base editing, prime editing, and epigenome editing**, enabling more precise and potentially safer interventions in age-related pathways (e.g., DNA repair, mitochondrial function, immune aging). [*inferred from general literature; aligns with NIH and major reviews, though not in the provided snippets*]  
- Early human trials using CRISPR for monogenic diseases have **validated the modality clinically and regulatorily**, de-risking platform and delivery technologies relevant to longevity indications. [*inferred from broad 2020–2024 clinical data; not in snippets*]

**Senolytics**

- Senolytic drugs aim to **selectively clear senescent (“zombie”) cells**, which accumulate with age and are implicated in chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and multiple age-related diseases. [*inferred from geroscience literature; concept not in snippets*]  
- Preclinical work has shown that removing senescent cells in animal models can **extend healthspan**, improve physical function, and delay onset of age-associated pathologies, catalyzing a wave of senolytic and “senomorphic” biotech startups. [*inferred*]

**AI-driven drug discovery**

- Across pharma, AI/ML is now being used to **identify new targets, design novel molecules, and optimize clinical trial design**, cutting early discovery timelines and costs. [*inferred from wide industry reporting*]  
- For longevity specifically, AI is being applied to **multi-omics datasets, longitudinal clinical data, and real-world biomarker streams** to identify aging signatures and stratify patients, allowing **biological-age–driven interventions** instead of purely chronological-age cohorts. [*inferred*]

The convergence of **validated genomic tools (CRISPR)**, **mechanism-based geroscience (senolytics, metabolic and immune modulators)**, and **AI-native R&D** has turned longevity from a largely academic field into an **investable therapeutics and platform category**.![Additional supporting visual content](https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201904/09/5cabe0bfa3104842e4a7acf8.png)

### 3. VC investment in longevity startups (anchor your “$5B+” claim)

Robust, recent, longevity-specific investment figures are typically compiled by sector analysts and are not fully captured in the snippets above; however, several convergent points support a multi‑billion‑dollar annual funding scale:

- Global **biotech and healthspan-related venture funding** has grown significantly in the last decade, with aging‑focused platforms (cell and gene therapy, advanced biologics, AI discovery, and digital health for seniors) representing a growing share of deals. [*inferred from 2020–2024 VC reports; not in snippets*]  
- McKinsey notes that **seniors will account for one-quarter of global consumption by 2050**, roughly double their share in 1997, which has drawn increasing private equity and VC attention to aging- and longevity-related products and services, from therapeutics to care models and financial products. [^bdc9bv]  

Because the exact “$5B+ in 2024” figure is not directly documented in the provided sources, you should:

- Attribute it to a **specific market intelligence provider** (e.g., “According to [named firm]…”).  
- Clarify scope in your materials: e.g., “longevity startups including therapeutics, platforms, biomarkers, and age-tech.”

This preserves credibility while still emphasizing that **capital inflows are now at multi‑billion‑dollar scale**.

### 4. Capturing the $7T+ “longevity economy”

- McKinsey projects that **seniors will account for about 25% of global consumption by 2050**, double their share in 1997. [^bdc9bv]  
- As age structures “invert” from pyramids to obelisks, older consumers and workers increasingly determine **growth, labor supply, and demand** across sectors including healthcare, housing, financial services, mobility, and consumer goods. [^bdc9bv]  
- Global life expectancy has extended by **~7 years since 1997**, reaching about 73 years in 2023 and projected to 77 years by 2050, further expanding the span of active consumption in later life. [^bdc9bv]  

Industry and policy work frequently frame this as a **multi‑trillion‑dollar “longevity economy”**, with some estimates in the **$7T–15T+ range** when including healthcare, financial products, housing, caregiving, and consumer markets serving older adults. [*inferred from combination of McKinsey consumption analysis and multiple external longevity-economy studies not in snippets*]

For your deck, you can credibly state:

- “By 2050, older adults will drive **around one-quarter of all global consumption**, underpinning a **multi‑trillion‑dollar longevity economy**.”[^bdc9bv]  
- “This demographic and spending power shift is structurally locked in by UN and national statistics, creating **high-visibility demand** for healthspan, independence, and productivity solutions over the coming decades.”[^3lhrqq] [^1ucdcd] [^bdc9bv]

### How to use this in a Longevity Fund pitch

- **Why now (macro):** Aging is accelerating toward **~2.1B people 60+ by 2050**, with 65+ approaching **1.6B**, making healthy longevity a central economic and policy priority. [^1ucdcd] [^3lhrqq] [^xs9htq]  
- **Why now (science/tech):** CRISPR, senolytics, and AI platforms have passed early validation, turning aging biology into **druggable, platform-ready space**.  
- **Why now (capital):** Multi‑billion‑dollar annual VC investment plus rising corporate and government interest signal a **new asset class**, not a niche.  
- **Why it’s big:** Seniors will drive **~25% of global consumption** by 2050, supporting a **multi‑trillion‑dollar longevity economy** in which solutions that extend healthspan, independence, and productivity can generate outsized financial and social returns. [^bdc9bv]
